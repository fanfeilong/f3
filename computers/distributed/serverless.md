## serverless cloud computing

* instance selectioin
* scaling
* deployment
* fault tolerance
* moniting
* logging
* security patches


//

* better autoscaling
* strong isolation
* platform flexibility
* service ecosystem support

In a critical departure, it charged the customer for the time their code was actually executing, not for the resources reserved to execute their program.

This distinction ensured the cloud provider had "skin in the game" on autoscaling, and consequently prodived incentives to ensure efficient resource allocation.




## serverful cloud computing

traditional approch


## diff

1. Decoupled computation and storage. The storage and computation scale separately and are provisioned and priced independently. In general, the storage is provided by a separate cloud service and the computation is stateless.

2. Executing code without managing resource allocation. Instead of requesting resources, the user provides a piece of code and the cloud automatically provisions resources to execute that code.

3. Paying in proportion to resources used instead of for resources allocated. Billing is by some dimension associated with the execution, such as execution time, rather than by a dimension of the base cloud platform, such as size and number of VMs allocated.
